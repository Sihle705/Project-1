# Project-1 
When using an Android Studio it consists of a generator button that allows the user to generate As a student it may take time to research to work on and get accurate information, but if an app is generated it is simple to get information, that is why I created a History App for historical students and educators that is fun and unexpected. 

 

The History App generates the age of the historical figures in comparison to the user, it has the Enter Age and Name button that allows the user to enter the age and name of the historical figures, it also has a clear button so the user can renter another age and name. 

 

When the name and age is entered the app can generate and show result of the Historical figures who have passed away, what is shown on the layout of the history App must be shown in code for the app to run. 

 

The historical app will allow the users to have access to database of historical figures, users can search for famous historical figures, the app will show the ages of the different figures and content like images so users can engage with their historical figures and create their own timelines in relation to historical period. 

 

As the History App is running you must use GitHub to run the app in relation with code and as the video must explain how the app is generated in the GitHub the code and layout must be added, the GITHUB provides all the action that has taken place while the app  was created and all the performance of the app will be recorded ,the history app and GitHub will give access to the users or developers to create and keep track of the historical figures and explore more. 

 

This app is more profound as users who want to learn about historical famous people can easily use the app to see when they died and get to know them specifically to know which historical figures played a role in the history, GitHub allows the user to create a repository for any project and the purpose of the repository is so that the user can easily make changes. 

The app should generate the age of the historical figures and state the name of the historical person and name as the user operates it.
